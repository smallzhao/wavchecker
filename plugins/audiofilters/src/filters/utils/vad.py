        Given a webrtcvad.Vad and a source of audio frames, yields only
        the voiced audio.

        Uses a padded, sliding window algorithm over the audio frames.
        When more than 90% of the frames in the window are voiced (as
        reported by the VAD), the collector triggers and begins yielding
        audio frames. Then the collector waits until 90% of the frames in
        the window are unvoiced to detrigger.

        The window is padded at the front and back to provide a small
        amount of silence or the beginnings/endings of speech around the
        voiced frames.

        Arguments:

        sample_rate - The audio sample rate, in Hz.
        frame_duration_ms - The frame duration in milliseconds.
        padding_duration_ms - The amount to pad the window, in milliseconds.
        vad - An instance of webrtcvad.Vad.
        frames - a source of audio frames (sequence or generator).

        Returns: A generator that yields PCM audio data.
